# heart_disease_Analysis
Analysis of heart disease using three models
This analysis resulted in Decision Tree with 86% accuracy, Random Forest with 95% accuracy and Logistic Regression with 90% accuracy.
The dataset contained a lot of duplicate values but i decided to analyze it anyway so, initially random forest had an accuracy of 100% because of it.
